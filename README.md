Hello! You may have found this profile from my resume, word of mouth, or other means of communication. Allow me to introduce myself:

- Computer Science Comprehensive and Mathematics student at University of Nebraska Kearney
- Proficient in a variety of languages including C++, Python, Lua, Bash.
- Knowledgeable of other languages including Javascript, HTML, C, CSS, x86, etc.

This is a relatively new GitHub account and as such, some projects are not on here or at lost to time. (those listed on my resume are currently WIP)
